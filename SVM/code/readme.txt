There are 6 python files. 
p1.py: code for problem 1
p2.py: code for problem 2
p3.py: code for problem 3
p4.py: code for problem 4
p5.py: code for problem 5
p6.py: code for problem 6
featurize.py: improved code for extracting features from spams and hams

Make sure the directory is correct before running the code and substitute the original featurize.py with the one provided.

Make sure to run p1.py before running all the other codes. Because p1.py splits the training data into validation sets and training sets, and store them in separate files.
