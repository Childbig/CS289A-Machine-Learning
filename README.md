# Machine-Learning-from-Scratch

This repository includes codes and some results from the homework of CS 189/289A at UC Berkeley. This course covers theoretical foundations of machine learning as well as hands-on implementation of popular classsification/regression/clustering techniques. All the codes are written in Python and topics include:

## 1. SVM for MNIST, Spam and CIFAR-10 
## 2. LDA and QDA for MNIST and Spam
## 3. Logistic Regression
## 4. Decision Tree and Random Forest for Census data and Titanic data
## 5. Neural Network for letter recognition
## 6. K-means, PCA, and Collaborative Filtering for recommendation system.
